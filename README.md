# DynamicLink-Demo-Android


Dynamic links smart URLs that allow you to send existing and potential users to any location within your iOS or Android app. They are different from deep links and more useful. 

Even if the user has not installed your app, the link information remains intact. Unlike deep links, dynamic links survive the app install process and do not lose the original linked content. Even new users see the content they're looking for when they open the app for the first time.

Android developers and startups can leverage this property of dynamic links. They can promote the app and drive their downloads easily. This is why we decided to write a step by step tutorial on [how to create dynamic links for Android apps](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/create-firebase-dynamic-links-android-tutorial/). 

However, there is a lot more when it comes to dynamic links and deep linking. You can hire an [Android app development company](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-app-development/) to implement dynamic link along with many other advanced features in your app project.
